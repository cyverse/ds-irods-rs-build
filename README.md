# ds-irods-rs-build

A program for creating an iRODS resource server that runs in a Docker container
and is configured for the CyVerse Data Store.

## Design

All of the sensitive information that would normally be set in the iRODS
configuration files as well as the clerver password have been removed. They must
be provided in a file named `cyverse-secrets.env` that will be loaded at run
time.

docker-compose was chosen as the tool to manage the building of the top level
image as well as starting and stopping its container instance.

The program `prep-docker` was created to simplify the generation of the top
level image's `Dockerfile` file and the `docker-compose.yml` file. As its input,
it takes an environment file that should provide the resource server specific
configuration values. In most cases, the generated files can be used without
modification.

There are three deployment artifacts: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and
`cyverse-secrets.env`. Once the correct configuration values have been defined,
these files will likely rarely need to be modified. All changes to Data Store
business logic will be made to the base image. This means that only the
following commands need to be executed to upgrade the resource server.

```bash
prompt> docker-compose build --pull
prompt> docker-compose up -d
```

If for some reason a base image upgrade doesn't work, the resource server can be
reverted to the last good base image by modifying the Dockerfile to use the tag
of the good image. Used the commands above to redeploy the reverted resource
server.

## Setting up the Resource Server

This section describes what needs to be done to run a containerized iRODS
resource server as part of the CyVerse Data Store.

### Host Machine

The server hosting the containerized resource server needs to have
docker-compose version 1.8 or new installed.

There needs to be a user on the host machine that the container will use to
run the iRODS resource server.

Two directories on the hosting server's file system need to be setup. One
directory will be used by the container to store the files managed by the
resource server. The other will be used to store the generated log files. Both
of these directories will need to be writable by the user running iRODS.

For the rest of the CyVerse iRODS grid to be able to communicate with this
resource server, the host needs a public FQDN or IP address. This doesn't
necessarily need to be the host's actually name or IP address. DNS aliases
and/or NAT can be used.  If NAT is used, there needs to be a static IP that
can be used to access the host.

The CyVerse iRODS grid will used the IP ports 1247-1248/TCP, 20000-20009/TCP,
and 20000-20009/UDP to communicate with this resource server. They need to be
accessible from the IP address range 206.207.252.0/25. Please ensure that all
local or institutional firewalls and router ACLs allow access to these ports
for that address range.

Any clients that need to connect directly to this resource server, will need to
potentially use 1247/TCP, 20000-20009/TCP, and 20000-20009/UDP. The firewalls
and router ACLs will need to allow access from these clients as well.

Here are the minimum reasonable requirements for the host server. It should be
running a 64-bit operating system that has stable support for Docker, like
CentOS 7. It should have at least two cores and 8 GiB of memory as well. The
file system hosting the vault should have at least 256 GiB of storage, and the
one hosting the logs should have at least 16 GiB.

### Preparing CyVerse's iRODS Zone

Before this generated image can be used, there are a few things that need to be
done.

First, the resource server's UNIX file system resource needs to be defined
within the CyVerse Data Store. The vault path within the container will be a
subdirectory of `/irods_vault` with the same name as resource being served. For
example, if the resource is to be named _demo_, then the vault path will be
`/irods_vault/demo`. If the hosting server's public name is _rs.domain.net_,
then defining the resource can be done with commands like the following.

```console
prompt> iadmin mkresc demo unixfilesystem rs.domain.net:/irods_vault/demo
prompt> iadmin modresc demo status down
```

Next, the corresponding passthru resource needs to be created for the UNIX file
system resource. The name of the passthru resource needs to be the name of
the UNIX file system resource with _Res_ appended. For example, if the UNIX file
system resource is to be named _demo_, then the passthru resource will be named
_demoRes_. This will be the default resource served by the resource server. This
can be done with a set of commands like the following.

```console
prompt> iadmin mkresc demoRes passthru
prompt> iadmin addchildtoresc demoRes demo
```

Finally, create a rodsadmin user for the resource server to use when connecting
to other servers in the grid as a client. If the chosen user name is
`demo-admin`, the following commands can be used to create the user with the
password `SECRET_PASSWORD`.

```console
prompt> iadmin mkuser demo-admin rodsadmin
prompt> iadmin moduser demo-admin password SECRET_PASSWORD
prompt> iadmin atg rodsadmin demo-admin
```

### Generating the Docker Source Files

The `prep-docker` program can be used to create a `Dockerfile` file and a
`docker-compose.yml` file that can be use to build and run a container hosting
an iRODS resource server that is configured to serve a given resource within the
CyVerse Data Store.

As its first command line argument, `prep-docker` expects the name of a file
defining a set of expected environment variables. It also accepts an optional
second argument specifying the directory where created files will be written. If
this isn't provided, the files will be written to the current working directory.

The `prep-docker` expects several environment variables to be defined in an
environment file when it is executed.

Environment Variable | Required | Default       | Description
-------------------- | -------- | ------------- | -----------
`IRODS_CLERVER_USER` | no       | ipc_admin     | the name of the rodsadmin user representing the resource server within the zone
`IRODS_HOST_UID`     | no       |               | the UID of the hosting server to run iRODS as instead of the default user defined in the container
`IRODS_LOG_DIR`      | no       | `$HOME`/log   | the host directory where the container will mount the iRODS log directory (`/var/lib/irods/iRODS/server/log`), `$HOME` is evaluated at container start time
`IRODS_RES_SERVER`   | yes      |               | the FQDN or address used by the rest of the grid to communicate with this server
`IRODS_RES_VAULT`    | no       | `$HOME`/vault | the host directory where the container will mount the vault, for the default, `$HOME` is evaluated at container start time
`IRODS_STORAGE_RES`  | yes      |               | the name of the unix file system resource that will be served

Here's an example.

```console
prompt> cat build.env
IRODS_STORAGE_RES=demo
IRODS_RES_SERVER=rs.domain.net

prompt> prep-docker build.env project

prompt> ls project
docker-compose.yml  Dockerfile
```

### Running the Resource Server

docker-compose is used to run the iRODS resource server. The
`docker-compose.yml` file assumes there is a file named `cyverse-secrets.env` in
the same directory. It should have the following environment variables defined
in it.

Environment Variable      | Description
------------------------- | -----------
`IRODS_CLERVER_PASSWORD`  | the password used to authenticate `IRODS_CLERVER_USER`
`IRODS_CONTROL_PLANE_KEY` | the encryption key required for communicating over the relevant iRODS grid control plane
`IRODS_NEGOTIATION_KEY`   | the encryption key shared by the iplant zone for advanced negotiation during client connections
`IRODS_ZONE_KEY`          | the shared secret used during server-to-server communication

Here's an example.

```console
prompt> ls
docker-compose.yml  Dockerfile  cyverse-secrets.env

prompt> cat cyverse-secrets.env
